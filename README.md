## How the Project Works
The project utilizes smart contracts deployed on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to manage ticket availability, confirm reservations, and process payments. Users interact with the platform through a web interface built with React, which communicates with the smart contracts on the ICP.

## How to Use the Project
To use the Decentralized Ticket Reservation System, users can visit the web interface and browse available events or transportation options. They can then select the desired tickets, enter their details, and confirm the reservation. Payments are processed securely through the smart contracts.
